# Fuchsia Flutter Keyboard

The current (16 January 2019) visual look for the Fuchsia keyboard. Run this flutter app on Android
or iOS to see how the Fuchsia keyboard will *potentially* look. All the code was taken from the Topaz
layer and reassembled to work without its other Fuchsia SDK dependencies. I did this to get familiar 
with the SDK and because I'm eager to see if this OS can replace my Android phone.
